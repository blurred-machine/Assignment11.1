Q.1) What is the use of SQLite open helper class inSQLite?

Ans.1) 
1) "SQLiteOpenHelper" is a helper class to manage database creation and version management.
2) This class is found inside android.database.sqlite package.
3) Fistly, we will create a class, and then we will extend SQLiteOpenHelper inside the class that we created.
4) Inside this class we need to override "onCreate(SQLiteDatabase)" and "onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase, int, int)" method.
5) This class takes care of opening the database if it exists, creating it if it does not, and upgrading it as necessary.
6) This class makes it easy for ContentProvider implementations to defer opening and upgrading the database until first use,
	to avoid blocking application startup with long-running database upgrades.
7) Constructor of this class is defined as: SQLiteOpenHelper(Context context, String name, SQLiteDatabase.CursorFactory factory, int version)
	where,
	Context: (Context) to use for locating paths to the the database. This value may be null.
	Name: (String) of the database file, or null for an in-memory database
	Factory: (SQLiteDatabase.CursorFactory) to use for creating cursor objects, or null for the default
	Version: (int) number of the database (starting at 1); if the database is older, onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase, int, int) will be used to upgrade the database; if the database is newer, onDowngrade(SQLiteDatabase, int, int) will be used to downgrade the database



Q.2) What is the use of OnUpgrade function in SQLiteOpenHelper class?

Ans.2)
1) "onUpgrade()" is called when there are some changes made in the database schema (version numbers are different).
2) "onUpgrade()" is basically for handling new db changes(could be new columns addition,table addition) for any new version of the app.
3) The purpose of onUpgrade is to manage a new database structure.
4) One of the most common use of "onUpgrade()" is to drop tables that are to be changed and recreate them, with variables defined in code for SQL statements.



Q.3) How to show SQLite database table information in Android application what is the best way to do it?

Ans.3)
1) According to me, we can use TableLayout with cursor to display table in best way.
2) Showing database information will be better suited with table layout, since table layout is not an adapter view, so we can't use cursor adapter with it.
3) TableLayout is a layout that arranges its children into rows and columns. A TableLayout consists of a number of TableRow objects, each defining a row
4) Cursor is the Interface which represents a 2 dimensional table of any database. When you try to retrieve some data using SELECT statement, then the database will first create a CURSOR object and return its reference to you. In simple words, Cursor is a Interface whice returns collection of your query data.
